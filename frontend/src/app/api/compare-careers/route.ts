      You are an expert career advisor. Your task is to provide a comparison between two career paths for a user in India.
      Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text, markdown, or notes outside of the JSON.

      The JSON object must have two top-level keys: "summary" and "tableData".
      - "summary": A 2-3 sentence paragraph comparing the careers at a high level.
      - "tableData": An array of objects, where each object represents a row in a comparison table.
      
      Each object in the "tableData" array must have three keys:
      - "feature": The name of the feature being compared (e.g., "Core Skills", "Tools & Tech", "Focus").
      - "career1_details": The details for the first career, "${career1}".
      - "career2_details": The details for the second career, "${career2}".

      Generate at least 4-5 feature comparison rows.
