# Name of the workflow, which will appear in the GitHub Actions tab
name: Deploy Backend to Google Cloud Run

# This section defines when the workflow should run
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push events
  push:
    # Only for pushes to the 'main' branch
    branches:
      - main
    # And only when files inside the 'backend/' folder are changed
    paths:
      - 'backend/**'

# Environment variables available to all jobs in this workflow
env:
  PROJECT_ID: skillsphere-final
  GAR_LOCATION: asia-south1 # Google Artifact Registry location
  SERVICE_NAME: skillsphere-backend
  REGION: asia-south1 # Google Cloud Run location

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    # The type of virtual machine to run the job on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository's code so the workflow can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Authenticate to Google Cloud using the Service Account Key
      # This is the more reliable method we switched to.

        with:

      # Step 3: Set up the Google Cloud SDK in the runner

      # Step 4: Configure Docker to authenticate with Google Artifact Registry
      - name: Configure Docker
