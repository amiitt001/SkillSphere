🚀 Getting Started Locally
Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later)

Docker Desktop

Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)

Firebase CLI (firebase-tools)

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

Configure Backend:

Navigate to the backend directory: cd backend

Create a .env file and add your Google Cloud PROJECT_ID and REGION.

Install dependencies: npm install

Authenticate for local development: gcloud auth application-default login

Configure Frontend:

Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontend

In src/lib/firebase.ts, replace the placeholder firebaseConfig with your actual Firebase web app configuration keys.

Install dependencies: npm install

Authenticate with Firebase: firebase login

Run the Application:

Start the backend server (from the backend folder): npm start

Start the frontend server (from the frontend folder): npm run dev

The application will then be available at http://localhost:3000.

☁️ Deployment
The application is designed for a full cloud deployment on Google Cloud Platform.

Backend (Cloud Run): The backend is containerized using Docker and deployed as a serverless service on Cloud Run. It is configured to run with a dedicated service account and has a minimum of 1 instance to prevent cold starts.

Frontend (Firebase Hosting): The frontend is a static Next.js application deployed to Firebase Hosting, which provides a global CDN for fast delivery.
